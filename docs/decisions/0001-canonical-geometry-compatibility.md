# ADR 0001: Canonical Geometry Compatibility After K1

- Status: Accepted
- Decision date: 2026-09-06
- Owning ticket: PRE11
- Current implemented contract: K1 schema version 1
- Reserved next contract: canonical extension schema version 2, not implemented

## Context

K1 is a strict, renderer-independent schema used by Python, JavaScript, K2
snapshots, the K3 API, and the K4/K5 editor. Existing version-1 snapshots lack
explicit page identity, first-class openings and electrical panels, optional
symbol orientation/bounds, and route provenance. Adding optional keys to K1
would still break its exact-key validators and would silently change a frozen
historical contract.

PRE4 and PRE5 now provide immutable source/page and derived-artifact identity.
PRE6 provides approved scale and elevation evidence. Future VLM work must use
those records without turning model output into canonical geometry or inventing
missing architectural or electrical meaning.

## Decision

K1 schema version 1 remains frozen and readable in its current exact shape.
Existing K2 snapshots are returned and edited in version 1 without migration,
backfill, or rewrite. The current Python and JavaScript entry points continue to
reject every unsupported schema version with their existing sanitized errors.

Canonical extension version 2 is reserved for a separately implemented U11
contract. The existing `layout_versions` table has a database check requiring
`schema_version = 1`, and prototype `create_all()` cannot alter it. U11 must
therefore use an additive one-to-one extension record associated with a newly
created, immutable K2 version-1 snapshot; it must not place version-2 JSON in
the existing geometry column or weaken the live constraint. Creation of the
base snapshot and extension must be one transaction.

There is no implicit read-time upgrade. A version-1 document that lacks required
source/review evidence remains version 1; software must not fabricate values to
make it extendable. Existing consumers read the stored version-1 base exactly as
they do now. A future extension-aware consumer must select an exact extension
validator by integer extension version and may compose a versioned view without
rewriting the base. Unknown versions fail closed. Downgrading or silently
discarding extension data is not promised.

The shared compatibility fixture is
`fixtures/canonical_geometry_compatibility_v1.json`. Python and JavaScript tests
must consume the same matrix. It requires the existing
`canonical_geometry_v1.json` to remain accepted and extension version 2 to
remain rejected by the K1 validator until U11 deliberately supplies both
runtimes with matching extension validators and
representative valid, empty, partial, malformed, and unsupported-version
fixtures.

## Data ownership

Candidate interpretation and append-only review records own evidence:

- immutable source document, source page, and one-based page number identity;
- source-pixel region or tile bounds and reversible transforms;
- model, prompt, adapter, artifact, OCR, and ambiguity provenance;
- raw opening, panel, symbol-orientation/bounds, and observed-route proposals;
- reviewer decisions, corrections, approval state, actor, and time.

The candidate uses source pixels. Regions may be absent for whole-page evidence.
Orientation, bounds, opening dimensions/types, panel attributes, and route
meaning remain nullable, unknown, or ambiguous when evidence and professional
review do not resolve them.

Canonical geometry owns only approved, renderer-independent metric results and
stable references needed to trace them back to approved evidence. The additive
version-2 extension is reserved to add:

- an approved source-plane reference tied to PRE4 source/page identity;
- first-class openings associated with canonical structure, without guessed
  type, height, thickness, or clearance;
- first-class electrical panels with stable identity and approved position,
  while electrical ratings and other undefined attributes remain deferred;
- optional approved symbol orientation and bounds when downstream rendering
  needs them; a position alone remains valid when those facts are unknown;
- an explicit route kind of `observed` or `generated` plus a provenance
  reference. Missing visible wiring produces no observed route.

Later routing-domain records, not VLM candidates or canonical rendering fields,
own generated-route algorithm identity, rule-set version, segments,
measurements, and electrical design choices. `observed` means visibly supported
by source evidence. `generated` means produced later by an approved routing
process; it must never be relabeled as observed.

## Adapter and negotiation rules

U2 must define candidate/review identifiers and source-pixel evidence compatible
with this ownership boundary. U11 must implement the extension dispatcher,
version-2 extension schema, and additive persistence in Python and JavaScript
together, then adapt only approved records using approved scale/elevation. It
must create a new K2 version-1 base snapshot and its extension atomically rather
than mutate history, and must preserve machine and review records independently.

APIs and consumers must inspect both the base `schema_version` and any explicit
extension version; they must not infer a version from available keys. A
version-1-only consumer continues to return the native base. An
extension-capable endpoint must fail closed on unsupported extensions rather
than drop their fields. No current K3 response claims to expose an extension.

## Consequences and deferred work

This decision adds no schema, table, endpoint, adapter, worker, model, route
algorithm, or 3D renderer. It approves no default opening dimensions, wall
height, panel rating, symbol rotation, electrical rule, or route. Exact
version-2 extension validation and additive persistence are U11 work after U2 defines the
candidate schema. K1/K2/K3 behavior and existing original uploads remain
unchanged.
